    "\n",
    "Usually, they make the development process easier by enabling you to focus on what's important instead of writing distributed and optimized training loops and plugging metrics / callbacks. Because we all forgot to call `.backward()` or `.zero_grad()` at least once.\n",

    "\n",
    "- pytorch-ignite, officially sanctioned by the pytorch team (its repo lives at https://pytorch.org/ignite/), which is developped by [someone from Toulouse](https://twitter.com/vfdev_5) - yes there is a member of the pytorch team living in Toulouse, we are not THAT behind in ML/DL :wishful-thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pytorch-lightning (https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) which has recently seen its 1.0 milestone and has bee developped to a company. It is more \"research oriented\" that pytorch-ignite, and with a lower abstraction level, but seems to enable more use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- skorch (https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch). This class was previously written in skorch. Skorch mimics the scikit-learn API and allows bridging the two libraries together. It's a bit less powerful but you write much less code than the two libraries above, and if you are very familiar with scikit-learn, it could be very useful for fast prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take a look at the [previous class](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/blob/main/deep/PyTorch%20Ignite.ipynb), the [official examples](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/examples/notebooks/) or the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/ignite/) if you need help using ignite**"
