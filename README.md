# Deep Learning for Computer Vision, practical session at ISAE-SUPAERO

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation of a "Deep Learning practical session" given at ISAE-SUPAERO on December 2nd/3rd 2019 and Nov 30/Dec 1st 2020

The introduction slides can be accessed at [this URL website](https://fchouteau.github.io/isae-practical-deep-learning). It is recommended to read it first as it contains the necessary information to run this from scratch.

There are three notebooks at the root of this repository, those as the exercises

## Where to run it ?

This hands on session is based on running code & training using [Google Cloud Platform Deep Learning VMs](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/), see `gcp/` for examples on configuring your own machine. 

However, this is runnable everywhere since data access is based on public URLs & numpy

Should you want to do this at home you can use [Google Collaboratory instances](https://colab.research.google.com/) - it's even easier than deep learning VMs
